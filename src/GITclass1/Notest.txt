---------- GIT class 1 ----------------------
1. what is version?
    Any updates in the previous functionality makes a new version.

2. What is Git ?
    Git is a tool to manage version... also called VCT (Version Control Tool). Git helps us to manage version.
    - Why do we need git?
    Because using Git is very easy to create backup of code, maintain versions in less space.

3. What is a Repository?
    A repository is a storage area.
- Local Repo -> Storage located inside our computer is called local repo.
- Remote Repo -> storage location in Github on the internet.

4. What is Github?
    Github is a remote repository for the back of our codes.

5. To communicate to git in Windows, we use GitBash.
    GitBash is used in Windows, its a form of terminal that can understand UNIX based commands.
    The best definition for GitBash/Terminal: It's a gateway of communication with the computer.
- UNIX -> It's an Operating System -- Git understands Unix based commands

6. To communicate to git in Mac, we use Mac terminal.
    Mac Terminal is used in Mac computer, it is already advanced and can understand UNIX based commands

7. To talk to computer, we use Commands:

    - pwd -> Print Working Directory , which is the current location gitBash/terminal
    - ls -> List , shows all the files or folders in the current location of terminal, which folder terminal can see
    - cd -> Change Directory , it helps terminal to move to a desired Directory (directory = folder)
            cd folderName -> moves to a particular folder if terminal is able to see it.
    - cd .. -> it moves terminal one step back in the path. In case of moving back
    - cd IdeaProjects
    - cd GiTclasses
    - git init -> initialize Git repository
    - git add . --> take a copy of all the files inside the folder and save them in the Staging Area
            (this step is called Staging Area "temporary storage" before adding/saving to actual Repo by git commit)
    - git commit -m "This is the first class of Git" --> take a copy of all the folders/files in the
                                                staging area and place them in the local repository
    - git log -> to see the user details, time and date of this commit

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



What is path ?
    Path is like an address to our files/folders in the computer.

Example: The path: Desktop/intellij/java/project1

Important:
    If we by mistake forgot to type the correct message or double colon " " in git commit -m "asfdsfsdf"
    We can do this to exit that particular sentence and type the correct one:
    ---------- Press Ctrl+C ----------
    Or if we make mistake in git commit - m "asdfasd" ... we put extra space after 'm' , we can retype
    the same command in correct way, it works better.

Working Directory:
    The folder where my files are located.
